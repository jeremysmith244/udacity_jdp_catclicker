# Projects done for the first part of Udacity's free javascript design patterns course. 

Just vanilla javascript and jquery to build some simple interactive front ends, stressing model octopus view design concepts. 

If anyone else is really new to javascript like me, check the examples on closures in particular. This concept is really interesting and unique to javascript. It strikes me that namespaces in javascript are a really dynamic thing because of this concept, as opposed to a Python or C/C++ where it is usually explicetly scoped.
